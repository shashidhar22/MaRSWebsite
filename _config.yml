description: The emergence of resistance to all currently available antimalarial drugs in multiple regions of the world represents a current global public health challenge. In order to monitor and address this situation, faster and more effective surveillance tools are required to track and monitor the emergence and evolution of drug resistance in malaria. The Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) project aims to address this challenge by standardizing the collection and mapping of genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance in malaria around the world.
